# Demultiplexing and Index Swapping - Assignment the Third

Write your code to demultiplex the samples. Be sure to:

- Incorporate feedback from peer code reviews
- Utilize appropriate functions (perhaps you want to `import bioinfo`???)
- Sufficiently comment your code/use docstrings/use type annotations on functions
- Use unit tests on functions/entire algorithm to ensure it works properly
- Create a useful report for the end user of your code
- Use argparse to "generalize" your code
- Be mindful of "simple" things you can do to optimize your code
- Follow the specifications laid out in [Assignment the First](../Assignment-the-first) for the code
    - Unclear? Ask!

Modules that are fair game to import:
- bioinfo
- argparse
- math
- gzip
- numpy
- matplotlib
- itertools

Final work will be submitted on [GitHub](.). Make sure your folder is well organized and final output is clearly labeled/summarized (a markdown file would be much appreciated!!). Use your code to demultiplex the samples and report:
- Percentage of reads from each sample
- Overall amount of index swapping
- Any figures/any other relevant data your code output
